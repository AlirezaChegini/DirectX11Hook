# DirectX11Hook

Template for Visual Studio 2017 that you could use to hook games that use DirectX11. The template also hook the IO as explained in my blog post, required to use properly ImGui.

> Note that the libraries are included inside the project, you should update them when required. Additionally, the offset used to hook the Present method may differ from one game to another, pay attention to that.
